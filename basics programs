1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list. 
ans:
a=[10,20,30,40,50,60,70]
sum=0
for i in a:
    sum=sum+i
print(sum)

2. Write a Python program to multiply all the items in a list.
Ans:

c=[1,2,3,4,6]
b=1
for value in c:
    b=b*value
print(b)


3.Write a Python program to get the lowest number from a list.
d = [10, 20, 30, 175, 40, 50, 60]
small_value=d[0]
for i in d:
    if i < small_value:
        i=small_value
print(small_value)

4.Write a Python program to get the mean number from a list.

ANS:
d = [10, 20, 30, 175, 40, 50, 60]
count=0
for i in d:
    count=count+i
print(count)
mean=count/len(d)
print(mean)


5.Write a Python program to get the median number from a list.

ANS:
d = [10, 20, 30, 175, 40, 50, 60]
count=0
for i in d:
    count=count+i
print(count)
median=count/2
print("meadian is :",median)

6.Write a Python program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are same from a given list of strings.
ANS:


e=['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221',"dad","mam"]
for i in e:
    if len(i) >=2:
        if i ==i[::-1] :
            print(i)
7.Write a Python program to clone or copy a list.
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
b=a.copy()
# snallow copy adress are different
print(b)
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
 # deep copy address are same
d=b
print(d)
print(id(b))
print(id(d))

# thia also address different
# this one type of copy through slicing
e=b[:]
print(e)
print(id(e))


8.Write a Python program to find the list of words that are longer than n from a given list of words.
n = input("enter list of words and ! to stop")
words = []
while (True):
    value = input()

    if (value == "!"):
        break
    else:
        words.append(value)
print(words)
wordsdict = {}
for word in words:
    wordsdict[word] = len(word)
print(wordsdict)
maxlen = max(wordsdict.values())
for k, v in wordsdict.items():
    if maxlen == v:
        print(k)
